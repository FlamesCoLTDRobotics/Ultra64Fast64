Pong Decompiler
A tool to decompile Pong games into human-readable code.

Overview
Pong is a classic video game that has been around since the 1970s. The game's source code, however, is often proprietary and not readily available to the public. This makes it difficult for individuals to learn from or modify the code. The Pong Decompiler solves this problem by converting compiled Pong games into a human-readable format.

Features
Decompilation of Pong games into human-readable code
Support for various Pong game formats and platforms
Output of decompiled code in a popular programming language (e.g. Python)
Easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI)
Usage
To use the Pong Decompiler, simply select the compiled Pong game file you wish to decompile and select the output format and language. The decompiled code will then be displayed in the GUI for you to view and save.
